    "The overall objective of this project is to analyze the hate crimes that have taken place in India. This data is picked from the National Crime Records Bureau of India and represents the state wise and district wise crimes against scheduled castes during the years 2001 to 2012. The primary goal is to inform the general public of the most frequent areas in which hate-crimes occur, how the number of hate crimes has changed over the years, and how the current trends presented to us could predict future hate crime patterns. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each record represents the number of each type of crime that occurred where the victim was registered as a person of a scheduled cast. Crimes are recorded regardless of the caste of the offender - which we thought was beneficial as this shows the avoidance of bias within data collection and allows for our findings to be more significiant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation and relevance of this topic is due to many reasons. One of the main reasons supported by a statistic, **INSERT STATISTIC HERE** {**INSERT LINK HERE**}. This is very current information and the issue of hate crimes in this region is not going away anytime soon. \n",
    "\n",
    "The relevance and importance of this topic in respect to data science is that through data analysis of the information we have access to, it will give us insight to crucial imformation to which we can use to minimize hate crimes dependent on a specific pattern, and bring about awareness of the patterns and insights we uncover. Crimes against the historically marginalized castes in India represent an extreme form of prejudice and discrimination and thus we aim to provide the numbers and data in a way that allows us to exploit such occurances backed up with numbers - to bring light to the issue and bring about change with how the system works. \n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this tutorial we attempt to uncover these trends of hate crimes in India in a clear, concsice manner - making the data available at hand easy to be interpretted and understood by the public. "
